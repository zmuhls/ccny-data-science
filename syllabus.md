## Course Details 📌
**Section**: CSC 10800 (LEC): Foundations of Data Science <br>**Dates**: Tue/Thu, 3:30-4:45pm, Aug 28 - Dec 21<br>**Location**: Marshak Science Building, Rm 410  <br>**Instructor**: Prof. Zach Muhlbauer | [zmuhlbauer@gc.cuny.edu](mailto:zmuhlbauer@gc.cuny.edu)<br>**Office Hours**: Wed 3-5pm over Zoom, or in person by appointment

## Course Description 📄

This course introduces the fundamental concepts and computational techniques of data science to all students, including those majoring in the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences. Students engage with data arising from real-world phenomena—including literary corpora, spatial datasets, and social networks data—to learn analytical skills such as inferential thinking and computational thinking. 

The competencies learned in this course will provide students with skills that will be of use in their professional careers, as well as tools to better understand, quantitatively and qualitatively, the social world around them. Finally, by teaching critical concepts and skills in computer programming and statistical inference, the class prepares students for further coursework in technology-aware fields of study, from Python programming and cultural analytics to the big umbrella of the Digital Humanities. The course is therefore designed for students who are new to statistics and programming. Students will make use of the Python programming language, but no computer science pre-requisites are required.   

This course does <strong>not</strong> satisfy degree requirements for Computer Science students, who should *not* be enrolled in this course. 

## Course Materials 🗂️

All required reading materials, activities, and instructions are provided on the [Schedule](https://zmuhls.github.io/ccny-data-science/schedule/) page. Additionally, datasets are provided on the [Datasets](https://zmuhls.github.io/ccny-data-science/datasets/) page, and assets for the course website are hosted [here](https://github.com/zmuhls/ccny-data-science). 

**Technical Readings**: These readings draw from Melanie Walsh's open-access [Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python ](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html)(2021), an online textbook written for students in humanities and social sciences to gain a practical introduction to the Python programming language within the context of cultural analysis. The textbook demonstrates how Python can be applied to a wide range of cultural materials, such as magazine articles, classic novels, TV scripts, technical manuals, social networks, and so more.  

**Critical Readings**: These readings engage with the complex social and political dimensions of "big data" in contemporary U.S. society. Through them, we will explore how data has evolved into the world's most valuable commodity. Authors of these pieces will therefore challenge us to critically engage with the ethical concerns, power imbalances, and hidden costs associated with today's data-driven economy.

## Class Technology 🛠️

### Hardware 🔌

*Bring a laptop or personal computer to (nearly) every time we meet.*

**Phones or Tablets:**  *I strongly recommend using a laptop for this course, even though it is technically feasible to take notes and run snippets of code on smart tablets or mobile devices. Relying solely on these devices will present challenges when need to view or modify Jupyter notebooks, run Python files, or stage coding environments that require computational resources which smart devices lack. Still, if you're unable to rent a laptop, then please reach out to me as early as possible so that we can discuss alternative arrangements.*

### Software 🖥️ 

**Jupyter Notebook:** In-class lessons and homeworks are done in Jupyter Notebook so that we can use markdown and Python simultaneously.  The notebooks assume a Python 3 installation with the standard modules from the **Anaconda** **installation** (e.g. NLTK, Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib) linked on the [schedule](https://zmuhls.github.io/ccny-data-science/schedule/). 

**Hypothesis Annotation:** Expect to post 2-3 annotations for most  critical readings we do in this class, each about 25-50 words in length and assessed on thoughtfulness, style and craft, and a demonstrated effort to respond to others. Hypothesis can also be a useful research tool and means of information management, so I encourage you to engage with it throughout the course. 

## Class Policies ⚐

**Respect and accountability are crucial to productive class discussions.**As co-producers of knowledge, I am expecting that we will practice respect for each other and be accountable to our words and actions. The classroom space is a learning space that can be, at times, uncomfortable, especially as we speak through our different perspectives and experiences. As long as we strive to be respectful to each other and accountable to the opinions, comments, questions, and concerns we share, this learning space will become a great place for us to nudge our boundaries. 

**Attendance and participation is required.** Learning a new programming language requires consistent practice and your understanding of the material will be greatly facilitated by your participation in class. Students are expected to come to class prepared, which includes completing the assigned reading before class and being ready to engage in class discussions.   

**Absences.** If you are unable to attend class, please email me in advance. If you are unable to email me in advance, please let me know as soon as it is possible. I do not require proof and would just need to know if you are not going to be in class. You may miss up to 3 classes. Missing more than 3 classes may impact your grades in class.    

**Plagiarism and academic integrity.** Plagiarism is copying and using other people’s words without proper acknowledgment or citation as it is indicated in the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity. All writing submitted for this course is understood to be your original work. Knowing acts of plagiarism carry serious consequences that may result in required resubmission, a failing grade, or worst. If I suspect your writing or work is plagiarized, then I will request a consultation with you to discuss the matter, at which point we will discuss next steps with care and best intentions in mind. In return, I expect that you will take time to read and more importantly adhere to [CCNY’s Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/).

**Generative AI Policy**. For permission to use large language models (LLMs) or generative artificial intelligence for programming activities or reflections, please write an email or speak with me in person about your interest in the technology. With that condition satisfied , I politely request that when you use ChatGPT-4x or Gemini you also share a link to the conversation or enclose a screenshot of the prompts used to generate output whether it be text, code, or multimedia. See the citation below for one such case where coauthorship of an image is attributed to ChatGPT-4.0 and myself, with the conversation linked after the date of use. 

> Muhlbauer, Zachary and ChatGPT-4.0. "AI Hype 2050." OpenAI, July 2024, Input: *Generate an image for a syllabus section that humorously makes light of AI hype in the year 2050.*  

**Grading policy.** I use a 100% grading scale to assess final course grades, which correlates with the 1000 total points that you can earn from class proceedings. If you have a question or concern about your grade in the class, please bring it to my attention  immediately.

|             | *B+  87-89* | *C+  77-79* | *D+  67-69* |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| *A  93-100* | *B   83-86* | *C   73-76* | *D   60-66* |
| *A- 90-92*  | *B-  80-82* | *C-  70-72* |             |

When learning a new area of study in addition to a programming language, it is inevitable that we end up with mistakes or “fail” to obtain our desired ends. For this reason and others, grades are awarded primarily on process and effort rather than accuracy or "correctness," with ample opportunities to participate in seminar and lab meetings.

## Posting Collaborative Annotations

For critical readings linked in the [schedule](https://zmuhls.github.io/ccny-data-science/schedule/), please use Hypothesis to annotate the text so that you can share your insights with peers and myself as part of our private annotation group. Annotations should range from 25 to 75 words, focusing on analytical depth, stylistic clarity, and interaction with peers. Hypothesis will serve not only as a platform for engaging with readings but also as a tool for managing and reflecting on scholarly information.

If you have not yet joined our private annotation group or cannot see your annotations, please do not hesitate to contact me; failing that, check out the [Hypothesis help](https://web.hypothes.is/help/) portal for support. 

## Submitting Programming Activities

We will use [GitHub](https://github.com) as a class submission portal for each programming activity. To get started with GitHub, please set up a project repository, initiate a README, and create two folders where you can upload completed notebooks and reflections for each programming activity.
* **[See here for an example](https://github.com/zmuhls/ccny-coding-portfolio/tree/main)**

**GitHub Instructions**:
1. **Create a new repository**: Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project. Name it appropriately, like `social-coding-portfolio`. Accept the option to initiate a `README.md`, which should serve as a project overview with an outline of its purpose, its structure, etc. 

2. **Create two folders**: (i) `Notebooks` for Jupyter Notebook files and (ii) `Reflections` for Markdown reflections. [Click here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository) for guidance on how to set up folders on GitHub.<br>

3. **Upload reflection and notebook**: Upload each submission as two files â€” one Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) to `Notebooks` and one markdown file (`.md`) to `Reflections`) and commit them with semi-descriptive messages.<br>
